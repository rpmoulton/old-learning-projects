The assignment called for the ability to change tesslation amount, the twist amount (angle) and show triangles on the system. My program allows the user to select between 360 degrees of twist using the sliding bar. (The default amount is 120) and then they can choose the amount of tesslation up to 11 times recursively. (I noticed that any more than 11 would cause my computer to slow down significantly and it wouldn't be able to handle it.) Like the example, the user may also choose the rotation speed of the triangle and also the direction of rotation. The user interface is located underneath the rotating triangle. I made most of the inputs sliders and buttons because then the user input does not need to be cleaned. Lastly, the user can draw the triangle using lines to better see the amount of tesslation and also to view some of the angles a little better than when it is the solid shape. Unfortunately I didn't start early enough to have enough time to change the type of shape so it's not a triangle, but I did have all the other functionality required.
